# EHCACHE CONFIG FILE FOR SPRING CACHE

# Global default. This "default" setting must be set for run EhCache.
default:

  name: defaultCache

  # Caching eternally without any life limit.
  # But even with this the all cached data will be lost on turning off the server,
  # unless you didn't set caching data saving type as pure disk-based.
  # And think twice if you are to set eternal to true,
  # as that has a possibility to make the cache data infinitely.
  eternal: false

  # Cached data lifespan.
  # If you set all two to 0, it's same as not setting any cache at all.
  # 1) timeToLiveSeconds(TTL): Absolute lifespan. Delete the cache after a specific time from the last creation.
  timeToLiveSeconds: 120
  # 2) timeToIdleSeconds(TTI): Relative lifespan. Delete the cache after a specific time from the last usage.
  timeToIdleSeconds: 60

  # Newly cached data is handled with First In Last Out rule.
  # And the order is heap first, disk next.
  # If you have a plan to use disk cache, you should consider that
  # the disk cache can be the bottleneck of processing speed easily.
  maxEntriesLocalHeap: 1000
  maxEntriesLocalDisk: 10000

  # Considering the situation the entry pool is full,
  # you can choose the criteria selecting firstly removed among cache data.
  # EhCache provides three options below.
  # 1. LRU(Least Recently Used) â˜…
  # 2. LFU(Least Frequently Used)
  # 3. FIFO(First In First Out)
  memoryStoreEvictionPolicy: LFU
